# 3D-Reservoir-Simulator
This 3D reservoir simulator is a complex tool developed using python that utilises Implicit Formulation Explicit Saturation (IMPES) to obtain pressure and saturation distribution across a heterogeneous multi-dimensional reservoir. This simulator is designed with utmost realism from the user input excel file to the reservoir initialisation
